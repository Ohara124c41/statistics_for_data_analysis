# Statistics for Data Analysis (Udacity)

This repo collects my work for the Udacity *Statistics for Data Analysis* track. Each sub-project lives in its own folder with data and notebooks so you can run or review them independently on Python 3.11+.

## Projects Overview

### 1. Salary Prediction via Linear Regression (`model_salary_data_linear_regression`)
- **Goal:** Build, fit, and interpret a salary prediction model using linear regression.
- **Highlights:** EDA (missingness, salary range, driver inspection), feature engineering (title flags, gender flag, education dummies), reduced OLS model with fit diagnostics and interpretation cells.
- **Run:** Open `salary_prediction_project.ipynb` and run all cells; data are in `salary_data.csv`.

### 2. A/B Test Results Analysis (`analyze_a-b_test_results`)
- **Goal:** Evaluate an A/B experiment for conversion differences.
- **Highlights:** Conversion rate comparisons, hypothesis testing, and effect-size interpretation.
- **Run:** Open `analyze_ab_test_results_project.ipynb` and execute cells sequentially.

### 3. Basketball Scoring Probabilities (`calculate_basketball_scoring_probabilities`)
- **Goal:** Model scoring probabilities in basketball game scenarios.
- **Highlights:** Probability calculations in notebook form with worked examples.
- **Run:** Open `calculate_basketball_scoring_probabilities.ipynb` and run cells.

### 4. Health & Sleep Quality Description (`describe_health_sleep_quality_data`)
- **Goal:** Explore and describe health and sleep quality data.
- **Highlights:** Descriptive statistics, visual exploration, and written takeaways.
- **Run:** Open `README.md` inside the folder for context; notebooks (if any) can be run directly.

## How to Work with the Repo

1. Ensure Python 3.11+ and common data-science packages (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, statsmodels where applicable).
2. From the repo root, open any project notebook listed above and run cells in order.
3. Each project keeps its own data files locally; no additional downloads are needed.

Feel free to dive into any project independently; keep changes scoped per folder for easy tracking.
